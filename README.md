# Java 2D Tile Game
This is a game I made in highschool just for fun to learn how game programming works at it's core. It only uses one dependency which is the backbone game engine that I also wrote to help setup basic games in a short amount of time. 

### Setting up the project with Eclipse
1. Open a new workspace 
2. Navigate to File -> Import -> Git -> Projects from git (with smart source)
3. Right click on the project and click Build Path -> Configure Build Path
	a. Make sure the jar BackboneEngine.jar is in the classpath, if not, add it.
	b. Go to the source tab and add the res folder as a dependency (This is so you can access images from a simple path)
